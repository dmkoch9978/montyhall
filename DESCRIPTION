Description: This package takes the user through the classic game show where the participant is 
presented with 3 doors and behind one is a new car. Each selection is chosen randomly, with no 
user participation. The point of this package is to test whether or not the Monty Hall Theory is 
correct. The Monty Hall Theory states that the participant is better off switching their choice 
rather than remaining with their original choice when presented with the opportunity after 
seeing one of the doors that contains the "goat". To achieve this, the package includes a 
function that loops through the game n times and determines the probability of winning the game 
when the participant changes or remains with their choice.
